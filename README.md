# A-Statistical-Analysis-of-Bias-in-Films
A study of film through the ages aimed at determining what biases are present in the casting of certain people

Our group is composed of Brett Grimes, Zachary Erickson, and Ryan Mahoney. The project is led by Dr. Sara Jensen.

Using C++, our group has been able to study the scripts and cast lists of 200 films quickly and efficiently.
